RecBole is developed based on Python and PyTorch for reproducing and developing recommendation algorithms in a unified,
comprehensive and efficient framework for research purpose.
Our library includes 53 recommendation algorithms, covering four major categories:

+ General Recommendation
+ Sequential Recommendation
+ Context-aware Recommendation
+ Knowledge-based Recommendation

We design a unified and flexible data file format, and provide the support for 27 benchmark recommendation datasets.
A user can apply the provided script to process the original data copy, or simply download the processed datasets
by our team.

## Feature
+ **General and extensible data structure.** We design general and extensible data structures to unify the formatting and
usage of various recommendation datasets.

+ **Comprehensive benchmark models and datasets.** We implement 53 commonly used recommendation algorithms, and provide
the formatted copies of 27 recommendation datasets.

+ **Efficient GPU-accelerated execution.** We optimize the efficiency of our library with a number of improved techniques
oriented to the GPU environment.

+ **Extensive and standard evaluation protocols.** We support a series of widely adopted evaluation protocols or settings
for testing and comparing recommendation algorithms.

## RecBole News
**12/06/2020**: We release RecBole [v0.1.2](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole/releases/tag/v0.1.2).

**11/29/2020**: We constructed preliminary experiments to test the time and memory cost on three
different-sized datasets and provided the [test result](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole#time-and-memory-costs)
for reference.

**11/03/2020**: We release the first version of RecBole **v0.1.1**.


## Installation
RecBole works with the following operating systems:

* Linux
* Windows 10
* macOS X

RecBole requires Python version 3.6 or later.

RecBole requires torch version 1.6.0 or later. If you want to use RecBole with GPU,
please ensure that CUDA or cudatoolkit version is 9.2 or later.
This requires NVIDIA driver version >= 396.26 (for Linux) or >= 397.44 (for Windows10).

### Install from conda

```bash
conda install -c aibox recbole
```

### Install from pip

```bash
pip install recbole
```

### Install from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole.git && cd RecBole
pip install -e . --verbose
```

## Quick-Start
With the source code, you can use the provided script for initial usage of our library:

```bash
python run_recbole.py
```

This script will run the BPR model on the ml-100k dataset.

Typically, this example takes less than one minute. We will obtain some output like:

```

```

If you want to change the parameters, such as ``learning_rate``, ``embedding_size``, just set the additional command
parameters as you need:

```bash
python run_recbole.py --learning_rate=0.0001 --embedding_size=128
```

If you want to change the models, just run the script by setting additional command parameters:

```bash
python run_recbole.py --model=[model_name]
```


## Time and Memory Costs
We constructed preliminary experiments to test the time and memory cost on three different-sized datasets  (small, medium and large). For detailed information, you can click the following links.<br> 

* [General recommendation models](asset/time_test_result/General_recommendation.md)<br>
* [Sequential recommendation models](asset/time_test_result/Sequential_recommendation.md)<br>
* [Context-aware recommendation models](asset/time_test_result/Context-aware_recommendation.md)<br>
* [Knowledge-based recommendation models](asset/time_test_result/Knowledge-based_recommendation.md)<br>

NOTE: Our test results only gave the approximate time and memory cost of our implementations in the RecBole library (based on our machine server).  Any feedback or suggestions about the implementations and test are welcome. We will keep improving our implementations, and update these test results.
