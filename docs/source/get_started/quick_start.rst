Quick Start
===============
Here is a quick-start example for using RecBole. RecBole supports general recommendation, sequential recommendation, context-aware recommendation and knowledge-based recommendation. We will select a representative model from each type of recommendation to show you how to train and test on the **ml-100k** dataset from both **API**
and **source code**.
